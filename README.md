Suppose you need to store data for a very large number of students in a distributed
document store such as MongoDB. Suppose also that the data for
each student correspond to the data in the student and the takes relations.
How would you represent the above data about students, ensuring that all the
data for a particular student can be accessed efficiently? Give an example of
the data representation for one student.
